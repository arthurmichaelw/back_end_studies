# Big O Notation ##

Big O notation is a metric or reference in how effecient an algorithm is. Big O Notation is broad in how it is used to determine an algorythms performance, and can be referenced in many ways. 
For Example, how long it takes to produce an output or number of CPU cycles. 

# 1. Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta #

**Omega** is the best possible result in an alogrythm runtime.

**Theta** in the expected result from an algorythm runtime.

**Big O** is how we express the worst case result of a in runtime.
